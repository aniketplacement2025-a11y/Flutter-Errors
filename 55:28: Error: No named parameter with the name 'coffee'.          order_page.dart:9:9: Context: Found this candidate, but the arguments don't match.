You're hitting two problems; the first is the actionable Dart compile error, and the second (the InvalidType crash) is likely a follow-on caused by the broken call site. Fixing the compile error will almost certainly remove the compiler crash.

Problem 1 — No named parameter with the name 'coffee'

Your main.dart is calling:

return OrderPage(coffee: args ?? sampleCoffee);


but OrderPage's constructor doesn't define a named parameter coffee. You have two ways to fix this:

Option A — Make OrderPage accept a named coffee parameter (recommended if that was the intent)
Edit lib/screen/order_page.dart and add a field + constructor parameter:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import '../models/coffee.dart'; // adjust path as needed

class OrderPage extends StatelessWidget {
  final Coffee coffee; // or Coffee? if nullable

  const OrderPage({
    Key? key,
    required this.coffee, // <-- add this
  }) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // use `coffee` here
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text(coffee.name)),
      body: /* ... */,
    );
  }
}


If coffee can be absent, change required this.coffee to this.coffee and make the field final Coffee? coffee; — and guard usages.

Option B — Call OrderPage using a positional argument (if the constructor expects it that way)
If OrderPage already expects a positional Coffee argument, change the call in main.dart to:

return OrderPage(args ?? sampleCoffee); // positional


But Option A is clearer and safer for named-argument code.

Problem 2 — Unsupported invalid type InvalidType(<invalid>) (compiler crash)

This error often appears when the analyzer/compiler can't reconcile an invalid/unknown type at a call site — commonly because of a mismatched constructor invocation (like using a named parameter that doesn't exist), or because an expression inside a map/literal contains a function/closure where a plain value is expected.

Fixing the constructor mismatch above will very likely resolve this. If it doesn't, search for map literals or widget constructors you recently edited that contain something like:

someWidget({ 'key': () { ... } }) // mistakenly using a function as a value in a place that expects a type


or check any return statements that build widget trees with map literals. The stacktrace shows the compiler failing while visiting a MapLiteral and a FunctionExpression, which matches the kind of code that triggers this problem.

Quick checklist to resolve now

Open lib/screen/order_page.dart and add the final Coffee coffee; + const OrderPage({Key? key, required this.coffee}) constructor as shown above.

Re-run flutter run / reload. If you still see the compiler crash, paste main.dart around line 50–70 and order_page.dart (the whole file if possible) and I’ll produce an exact patch.

If you used a nullable coffee (Coffee?), make sure every use of coffee checks for null or uses coffee! where safe.

Small extra tips

Keep the Coffee model import path correct in order_page.dart. If you forget the import the type will be unknown and cause errors.

Prefer named parameters for readability in pages that take model objects.

After you add the constructor, if you intended to pass other navigation args, ensure args is typed correctly: final args = ModalRoute.of(context)?.settings.arguments as Coffee?; (or parse accordingly).

If you want, paste the exact OrderPage file or the main.dart snippet around the failing line and I’ll give you the one-click patch to drop in.
