The Real Problem:
Android Emulator doesn't have direct HTTP access to your localhost server without proper configuration. The emulator runs in a virtualized environment with its own network stack.

The REAL Solution: ADB Reverse Proxy
The ONLY reliable way to make localhost:3002 work in Android emulator is:

Step 1: Check if ADB can see your emulator
bash
adb devices
Step 2: If no devices found, start your emulator properly
bash
# Find your emulator
emulator -list-avds

# Start your emulator (replace with your actual AVD name)
emulator -avd Medium_Phone_API_36.1
Step 3: Run ADB reverse command
bash
adb reverse tcp:3002 tcp:3002
Step 4: Verify it worked
bash
adb reverse --list
Should show: tcp:3002 tcp:3002

If ADB commands don't work:
Find your Android SDK path:
bash
flutter doctor -v
Use full path to ADB:
bash
# Example:
C:\Users\ratho\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe reverse tcp:3002 tcp:3002
Alternative: Use Chrome for Development
Since you can't get the emulator working, use Chrome:

bash
flutter run -d chrome
Simple Config That Will Work:
simple_config.dart
dart
class SimpleConfig {
  // For now, just use this simple config
  static const String baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3002';
  
  static const String getAllCoffees = '$baseUrl/coffees';
  static const String getCategories = '$baseUrl/categories';
  static const String cart = '$baseUrl/cart';
  // ... other endpoints
}
The Truth About Android Emulator Networking:
Android Emulator has its own virtual network

localhost in emulator ≠ localhost on your PC

10.0.2.2 only works in SOME emulator configurations

ADB reverse is the ONLY guaranteed solution

What to Tell Your Client:
"✅ The app works perfectly in web browsers
🔄 Android emulator requires additional network configuration that we're troubleshooting
📱 The code maintains localhost:3002 as required"

Immediate Action:
Run your app in Chrome:

bash
flutter run -d chrome
This will at least prove your server and Flutter code are working correctly, while we figure out the emulator networking issue.

The problem is NOT your Flutter code - it's the Android emulator network configuration that's blocking the connection to your localhost server.

Perfect! The ADB reverse command worked (no error means success). Now let's verify and test:

Step 1: Check if the reverse proxy is active
bash
adb reverse --list
You should see:

text
tcp:3002 tcp:3002
Step 2: Test the connection in Android emulator
Open Chrome browser in your Android emulator

Visit: http://localhost:3002/coffees

You should see your JSON coffee data

Step 3: Test your Flutter app
Now run your Flutter app:

bash
flutter run
What ADB Reverse Does:
✅ Creates a tunnel from Android's localhost:3002 to your PC's localhost:3002

✅ Your Flutter code can keep using http://localhost:3002 (client requirement satisfied)

✅ Actually connects to your Express.js server on your development machine
